Array of objects
Each object has:
  type: (sauce, veggies, meat, size...)
  Name: (eg: veggies can be "tomatoes", "Onions", ...)
  Price: (number)


When the user selects "Place ORder", we'll build up the array based on what's selected.
[
    { "type": "veggie", "name": "tomatoes", "price": 1},
    { "type": "veggie", "name": "onions", "price": 1}
]

for each element in the array:
  print name and price
